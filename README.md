# rust-cwrap
A rust version of [cron-wrap](https://github.com/crustymonkey/cron-wrap)

## About
This is mostly the same implementation as [cron-wrap](https://github.com/crustymonkey/cron-wrap), but without the SMTP options.  Those *may* be added
later, but for now, this should be fully usable for most cases.

See `cwrap --help` for all of the various options here.
